//! Network Protocol Definitions
//!
//! This module defines the messages and data structures that are sent
//! between the client and server. Using a shared protocol ensures both
//! sides speak the same language.
//!
//! # Learning Note
//! In Rust, the networking layer needs to serialize/deserialize data.
//! Lightyear handles this with bincode, but you'll define the structures here.

// TODO: Define your protocol messages here
// Example:
// #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug)]
// pub struct PlayerInput { ... }
