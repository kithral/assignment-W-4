//! Shared ECS Components
//!
//! Components are data containers in Bevy's Entity Component System.
//! Components defined here are used by BOTH client and server, ensuring
//! that game state is represented identically on both sides.
//!
//! # Learning Note
//! Bevy uses a data-oriented design. Components are pure data (structs),
//! and Systems operate on them. This separation is key to Rust's approach
//! to game development.

// Uncomment when you start defining components:
// use bevy::prelude::*;

// TODO: Define your shared components here
// Example:
// #[derive(Component, Clone, Debug)]
// pub struct Position {
//     pub x: f32,
//     pub y: f32,
// }
